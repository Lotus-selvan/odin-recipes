    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Curd rice, or thayir sadam, is a simple, cooling South Indian dish made from cooked rice mixed with fresh yogurt and often enhanced with a flavorful tempering of mustard seeds, lentils, curry leaves, ginger, and sometimes chilies.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Mutton</li>
        <li>Aromatic rice(like basmati or seeraga samba)</li>
        <li>ghee</li>
        <li>onion</li>
        <li>tomatoes</li>
        <li>ginger-garlic paste</li>
        <li>yogurt</li>
        <li>cardamom</li>
        <li>fresh coriander</li>
        <li>mint leaves</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Marinate the Mutton: Mix the mutton pieces with a marinade of yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, and a blend of spices like garam masala, red chili powder, and turmeric. Let it marinate for at least a few hours or, ideally, overnight in the refrigerator to tenderize the meat.</li>
        <li>Parboil the Rice: In a separate pot, cook high-quality basmati rice with whole spices (like bay leaves, cardamom, and cinnamon) until it's about 70% cooked. Drain the rice and set it aside.</li>
        <li>Cook the Mutton: Brown sliced onions in a heavy-bottomed pot, then add the marinated mutton and cook it until it's almost tender. This creates a rich, flavorful gravy.</li>
        <li>Layer and "Dum" Cook: Layer the partially cooked rice on top of the mutton and gravy in the pot. Sprinkle with fried onions (birista), fresh mint and coriander leaves, and saffron-infused milk. Seal the pot tightly with a lid or dough and cook on very low heat ("dum" cooking) for 30-40 minutes. This slow cooking method allows the flavors to meld and the rice to absorb the aroma and taste of the mutton and spices.</li>
        <li>Rest and Serve: After cooking, turn off the heat but let the biryani rest for another 10-15 minutes before gently fluffing and serving.</li>
